# Bunny's Funz and Bunz!

A nostalgic trip back to the early 2000s, **Bunny's Funz and Bunz!** recreates the charm of retro gaming websites like Newgrounds and AddictingGames. This project is my personal tribute to those times, featuring a collection of games I designed to evoke that classic feel. Whether you're here to relive childhood memories or just explore some fun games, you're in for a treat!

## 🎮 About the Project

Motivated by the nostalgia of early 2000s gaming websites, I built **Bunny's Funz and Bunz!** as a playful homage to the era. This project showcases **8 unique games** developed using Phaser.js, combined with a custom retro-themed website to host them.

Each game represents a learning milestone in my journey as a developer. Some took minutes, while others (*looking at you, Not Flappy Bird*) required hours of troubleshooting. Either way, they're here for your enjoyment!
